# Installation

In the project root folder, run:

    composer install
    
Then import **birdoffice.sql** in your database.

### Unit tests

To be honest, I did not run my unit tests.
I was on windows' MINGW32 and simple-phpunit does not run on it.

To run them, go to your project root folder and run :
   
    ./vendor/bin/simple-phpunit
